This is a SCILAB Project. 
It is based on a sandwich making shop. Implemented with GUI and various mechanisms, this allows the user to select the items required in the sandwich and displays the end cost of the product in the Scilab console(command window).
The user can keep track of the options selected in the scilab console(command window).
This also makes use of a coupon based system which gives discounts to customers who produce correct coupon codes.
